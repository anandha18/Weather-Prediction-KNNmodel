# Weather-Prediction-KNNmodel
Weather Prediction using K nearest neighbor model in python
This a data science projec which I made for myself to learn and explore.
In this project I have taken a dataset of weather in seattle from kaggle.com
Some EDA is performed to see how is weather affected by the change in one or more variable.
Then using sklearn package, i used KNN algorithm to predict the future weather which came out to be 77% accurate.
